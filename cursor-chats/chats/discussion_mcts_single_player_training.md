I'm excluding the opponent's turn in training with my neural network, which has only one player's action, and manually sampling the opponent's action.

Is it possible to consider only one player's actions for training an agent through MCTS with Self-Play?

That will result in one action leading to multiple next steps.
Another problem is that there might be an optimal counteraction for the opponent, but the sampling performance cannot be improved during training for another player

**Assistant:**
Okay, let's break down your approach and the implications for MCTS self-play.

You're asking if it's possible to train an agent using MCTS self-play where the network *only* learns the policy/value for one player (e.g., the player whose turn it is at the root of the search), while the opponent's moves are handled by some other mechanism (in your case, sampling) within the MCTS simulation itself.

**Feasibility and Standard MCTS:**

1.  **Technical Feasibility:** Yes, you *can* structure your MCTS loop like this, as your current code demonstrates. The MCTS algorithm itself (select, expand, evaluate, backpropagate) can still run.
2.  **Deviation from Standard Self-Play (AlphaZero-style):** This is a significant deviation from how MCTS is typically used in successful self-play agents like AlphaZero. In standard self-play:
    *   The **same network** is used to evaluate positions and provide policy priors for **both** players.
    *   The network learns general game understanding (value of a state, good moves in that state) independent of whose turn it *currently* is at the root of the *entire game*. The input features to the network typically include whose turn it is in the specific board state being evaluated.
    *   The MCTS search explores the game tree strategically for *both* sides, using the network's policy priors and UCT selection for opponent moves as well.

**Analyzing Your Concerns:**

1.  **"One action leading to multiple next steps."**
    *   You're right. In your current implementation within `_expand_and_evaluate` (lines 146-154), when you expand a `leaf_node` corresponding to a state after the primary player's move `move`, you immediately simulate the opponent's response (`sim_board.push(opponent_move)`) *before* creating the `child_node`.
    *   This means the `child_node` doesn't represent the state *immediately* after `move`, but rather the state *after* `move` AND the *sampled* opponent response.
    *   The `prior_p` assigned to this `child_node` comes from the network's evaluation of the `leaf_node` state (before the opponent's move), but the child node represents a state *after* a random opponent move. This creates a mismatch.
    *   The `value` backed up from this branch is based on the network's evaluation of the `leaf_node` state, but the simulation path taken within the expansion included a random opponent move. This complicates the interpretation of the backed-up value.

2.  **"Optimal counteraction... sampling performance cannot be improved..."**
    *   This is the **critical limitation** of your approach. By sampling the opponent's move (even using a heuristic like `sample_action` which might be better than pure random but is still fixed), the MCTS search and the network **never learn to anticipate or play against strong counter-moves**.
    *   The agent only learns how to maximize its chances against a *predictably weak* (random or fixed heuristic) opponent.
    *   The core strength of self-play comes from the agent playing against progressively stronger versions of *itself*. It learns to exploit its own weaknesses and defend against its own best strategies. Your approach breaks this crucial feedback loop for the opponent's side.

**Conclusion:**

While you *can* implement MCTS this way, it's unlikely to train a strong agent compared to standard self-play. The agent will be optimized to play against a weak, non-learning opponent model embedded directly into the search, rather than learning robust strategies that anticipate strong replies.

**Recommendation:**

For effective training via MCTS self-play, it's highly recommended to use the **standard approach**:

1.  Have your `ChessNetwork` predict policy and value for the current player in *any* given board state (its input should likely include whose turn it is).
2.  Use this *same* network during MCTS to provide priors and evaluate nodes, regardless of whether the node represents a state where it's "your" AI's turn or the opponent's turn within the simulation tree.
3.  The MCTS selection phase (using UCT) will handle the exploration of both players' moves based on the network's guidance and visit counts.

This allows the agent to learn from playing against itself, constantly improving its understanding of strategy and counter-strategy for both sides of the board.
