# Summary: Chess Network Architecture Discussion

This document summarizes the discussion regarding the neural network architecture for the chess AI.

1. **Initial Question & Context:**
   * Question: "Do you think this encoding is a good idea? The model should interpret it into 16 dims to decide the legal actions anyway"
   * Context: Discussion about piece type encoding and network architecture

2. **Architecture Changes Made:**
   * Added `DEFAULT_DIM_PIECE_TYPE = 16` constant
   * Modified `PolicyHead` to accept `dim_piece_type` parameter
   * Updated channel calculations in `ChessNetwork` to use `dim_piece_type`
   * Adjusted linear layer dimensions in `PolicyHead`

3. **ConvBlock Modifications:**
   * Initially implemented parallel convolutions with different kernel sizes:
     - 3x3 kernel with padding=1
     - 5x5 kernel with padding=2
     - 7x7 kernel with padding=3
   * Each path processed input independently and concatenated results
   * Added final 1x1 convolution for channel adjustment if needed

4. **Reverted Changes:**
   * Simplified `ConvBlock` back to single convolution
   * Removed parallel processing paths
   * Restored original kernel_size and padding parameters

5. **Key Decisions:**
   * Maintained 16-dimensional piece type encoding
   * Simplified convolution architecture for better efficiency
   * Kept piece type information separate from feature channels
   * Adjusted network to properly handle piece type dimensions

6. **Outcome:**
   * Network now properly handles piece type information
   * Architecture is more streamlined and efficient
   * Maintained separation between feature channels and piece type information
   * Improved clarity in channel dimension management
