    A chess.Board subclass that tracks the original identity and current state
    of all 32 starting pieces throughout the game. Includes a flag indicating
    if the current state (set via FEN/map) is theoretically possible based on
    initial piece counts.

    Attributes:
        piece_tracker (PieceTracker): Maps original piece ID to current state.
        is_theoretically_possible_state (bool): Flag indicating if the piece counts
            found during the last FEN/map initialization are consistent with
            a state reachable from the standard start (ignoring position/legality).
            Set to False if counts exceed standard initial numbers (e.g., >8 pawns,
            >1 Queen, >2 R/N/B per color). Note: Multiple Q/R/N/B *can* exist via
            promotion, but this flag reflects impossibility based *only* on the counts
            found when initializing from a state snapshot.
